# PLAN.md — AI Support Agent Builder

## Goal
Build a SaaS platform to design, deploy, and monitor AI support agents across multiple channels (web, Slack/Teams, Intercom/Zendesk, WhatsApp/SMS, Email, optional voice). Agents include intents, prompts, flows, tools, guardrails, and SLAs, with analytics and escalation to humans.

## Build Strategy
- Continuous full-stack build: no phases/stops, end-to-end delivery.
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + Chakra UI + Tailwind.
- Backend: NestJS API Gateway, Python workers, Postgres + pgvector, Redis, NATS, S3/R2.
- Workers handle routing, retrieval, reranking, agent orchestration, tools, ticketing, evals, exports, QA.
- Multi-tenant architecture with RLS isolation.
- Compliance: audit logs, DSR endpoints, retention, SSO/SAML/SCIM.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Terraform IaC, blue/green deployments.
- Testing: unit, integration, regression, E2E, load, chaos, security.

## Success Criteria
- Deflection ≥35% in 60 days without lowering CSAT.
- First-contact resolution ≥65%.
- CSAT ≥4.3/5 on bot-resolved convos.
- Time-to-first-token <1.8s p95 (web).
- Evaluation pipeline success ≥99%.
- Citation coverage ≥95% in strict mode.
- Widget error rate <0.1% of sessions.
